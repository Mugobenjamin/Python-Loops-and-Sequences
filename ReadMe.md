  **Questions**
  **Loops**
1. Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. For numbers that are divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz". For numbers divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".
2. Using a while loop, write a function that continuously asks the user for input until they type the word "exit". The program should print each word entered by the user before asking for the next input.
    **Sequences (Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries)**
3. Given the list nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], write a Python function using a loop that returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.
4. Write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a new list where each string is reversed. For example, for the input ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the function should return ["elppa", "ananab", "yrrehc"].
5. Write a Python function that takes a dictionary as input and prints all the keys whose values are even numbers. Example: Given the dictionary {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}, the function should print 'a' and 'c'.
6. Given a tuple of numbers, e.g., (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), write a Python function using a loop that returns the largest number in the tuple.
 **Function Writing Using Loops and Sequences**
7. Write a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list as input and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed. You cannot use the set function to solve this problem.
8. Write a function that takes a dictionary and an integer n as input and returns a list of keys from the dictionary where the value is greater than n. For example, for the dictionary {'a': 5, 'b': 12, 'c': 3} and n = 4, the function should return ['a', 'b'].
9. Write a Python function that accepts a list of integers and a target sum. The function should return True if there are two distinct numbers in the list that add up to the target sum, and False otherwise.
10. Write a function that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains two elements: a string and an integer (e.g., ("apple", 5)). The function should return a dictionary where the strings are the keys and the integers are the values.
